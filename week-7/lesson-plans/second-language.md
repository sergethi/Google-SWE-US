# Learning a Second Programming Language Lesson Plan

### Overview
Apprentices will spend the week learning a new programming language that they will use on the job. This session will help apprentices develop a plan to learn a new programming language, and expose them to the appropriate resources.

### Objectives
Apprentices will be able to:

* Discover strategies and resources for learning a new programming language.
* Create a ProP plan for learning a new programming language.

### Assets

| **Key Objective**: Apprentices learn their objective for the week and assess their current programming skills.                                                                                                         |
| *Options for Delivery* <br> Coach Led Instruction:  Read speaker notes on slides 2 - 7. On slide 4, have apprentices jot down their list of programming languages and then have them compare it to a partner's list.  |

| Resources for Learning a Language                                                                    |

| **Key Objective**: Apprentices explore the resources available to them as they learn a new language. |
| *Options for Delivery* <br> Coach Led Instruction: Read speaker notes on slides 8 - 15. Consider asking A's to share their experience using some of the resources that have been listed. For Stackover Flow, consider going to the website and explain how the site can be used to answer any questions that A's might have. Encourage A's to create an account so they can contribute as well.   |

| Pick a Language                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| *Options for Delivery* <br>  Activity: Apprentices should rank the three languages that they are being asked to learn in order of their familiarity. It's important to note that apprentices should prioritize Java if they are not that familiar with the language. Once they've made a decision about the language they are going to learn, have them fill out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1KT72tzrIpXNN7kfJTRAhU50DGpIvnszydzalMhRl3Ww/edit). <br><br> Once all apprentices have submitted their response, place apprentices in groups of 3-4 based on the language they chose. Try to create groups of apprentices with varying skill levels. |

| **Key Objective**: Apprentices develop a ProP unit plan and submit it for approval.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| *Options for Delivery* <br>  Activity: Apprentices should meet with their Learning Pods to determine who will be the team lead each day for the week they are together. <br><br> Apprentices then have the remainder of the session to develop a ProP plan related to the language that they chose. When A's are done with their plan, have them go over it with their Learning Pod for feedback. Once A's make edits, have them submit the ProP plan to coach. Coach should look over the plan and make suggestions if needed. If A's get their plan approved early, they can spend the rest of the time executing their plan. |
