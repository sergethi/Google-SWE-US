## Code Review II (30 - 45 mins)

### Flow + Objectives

* **Project Overview** (*Deployed App*)

    * Audit deployed application, starting with Tiers I and II in the browser noting any bugs, UX concerns, or broken features

    * For any major breakages, triage and discuss relevant code blocks to strategize for any "on fire" debugging

    * Estimated time: 5 - 10 mins

* **Code Review** (*Tiers II-IV*)

    * Comprehensive review of technical implementation of current and next Tier features accomplished

    * Audit code quality on main branch, reinforcing style best-practices for any portfolio-facing code project (e.g, testing, no console logs, documentation, semantic variable names, consistent formatting, etc.)

    * Estimated Length: 10 - 15 mins

* **Feature Roadmap**

    * Discuss remaining features to implement to complete and deploy whichever Tier they are on, including task breakdown and technical architecture

    * Estimated Length: 5 - 10 mins

* **Ticket Writing**

     * Coach will select an apprentice to lead the team in authoring relevant User Stories and Tasks based on the Feature Roadmap Discussions

    * Estimated Length: 5 - 10 mins
