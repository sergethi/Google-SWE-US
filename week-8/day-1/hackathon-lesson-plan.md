| **Key Objective**: Apprentices learn about the week roadmap and begin brainstorming their application idea.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| *Options for Delivery* <br> Coach Led Instruction: Coach should read speaker notes for slides 7 - 11. Once apprentices are aware of the roadmap for the week, apprentices should have time to jump into breakout groups and begin brainstorming their application idea. Coach should hop into groups to hear what their ideas are, and make sure that the projects they are considering are relevant and within scope. Explain to them that they have the rest of the day to brainstorm and begin working on their boilerplate/tickets.|
