# Assignment

For the past week, you and your peers have worked to learn about a new programming language or technology that you are expected to use while on the job. For this assignment, you will have the opportunity to practice using those newfound skills by deploying a full stack project.

For this project, you have several options for what you can do:

* Extend a previous project to include new features that utilize the language or technology that your group learned about.
* Recreate (port) a previous project using the new language or technology.
* Come up with your own application!

Rather than provide a series of functional requirements, your team is responsible for coming up with a list of functional requirements or user stories for your feature or new project. These functional requirements should mirror the format of previous requirement lists, and should match the timeframe provided to complete the project. The project will still have non-functional requirements provided by your coach.

Your team has a (coach specified) number of days in which to [design](https://multiverselearningproducts.github.io/curriculum/Bootcamp/Unit-6-End_Of_Bootcamp_Group_Project/0.6.4-Design) and develop your app.

All code must be stored in a GitHub repository and [git branches and pull requests](https://multiverselearningproducts.github.io/curriculum/Bootcamp/Unit-6-End_Of_Bootcamp_Group_Project/0.6.6-Branching_and_Pull_Requests) used to review code changes from individuals.

Each GitHub repository has a section for hosting documentation called a 'wiki'. A README.md file in your repository can describe at a high level what your project is about; you can use the wiki to add additional documentation.

You should work in an [Agile](https://multiverselearningproducts.github.io/curriculum/Bootcamp/Unit-6-End_Of_Bootcamp_Group_Project/0.6.3-Agile_Development) manner, using a [GitHub project board](https://multiverselearningproducts.github.io/curriculum/Bootcamp/Unit-6-End_Of_Bootcamp_Group_Project/0.6.5-GitHub_Projects) to document and assign tasks and holding daily standups to communicate progress and any blockers.

You may want to [deploy your code](https://multiverselearningproducts.github.io/curriculum/Bootcamp/Unit-6-End_Of_Bootcamp_Group_Project/0.6.7-Deployment_with_Heroku) to a cloud server.

You may want to make use of the following tools to support your development:

* A Google chat to aid team communication
* A [Jam Board](https://jamboard.google.com/) to brainstorm ideas

## Show and tell

At the end of the week you will have the opportunity to present your project as a group. Below are some suggested talking points. To show your app working you can prepare a short demo that showcases the main functionality of the app.

* How did you find working as a group?
* How did you justify the creation of your new feature?
* How easy was it to incorporate tools and design patterns you had been introduced to during the bootcamp?
* What would you do differently next time?

## Non-functional requirements (the constraints on the system)
| Id | Priority | Description |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| NF1 | MUST | The application must have client & server-side validation in place |
| NF2 | MUST | The application must have evidence of automated unit testing |
| NF3 | MUST | The application code must be documented in a manner that it would be easy for a new developer to understand |
| NF4 | MUST | The application code must be stored in a GitHub repository and deployed on Heroku. |
| NF5 | MUST | There must be documentation which describes:  * how to run the application * features of the application * design decisions * team roles & responsibilities * links to UI wireframes * links to UML use case, class and sequence diagrams * links the the database design * links to a unit test coverage report |
